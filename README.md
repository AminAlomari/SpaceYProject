In this project, a rival company to SpaceX (SpaceY) uses SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket data to determine the rocket first stage landing successes and also uses the rocket data to determine the cost of a launch. Space Y uses the data to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launch cost to be 62 million dollars. Whereas for other companies the cost of a rocket launch is more than 165 million dollars.​

Research Questions:​

1. Which launch sites perform best?​

2. What payload ranges succeed most often?​

3. How do geography and booster versions affect outcomes?​

4. Can we build an accurate model to predict success?​

Goal & Motivation: ​

Predicting reusability = Predicting launch costs.​
